# MIR: Harmonic feature extraction using CRNN
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resouces for the final project of COSE474-2023F.

The goal of this project is to improve upon traditional methods of harmonic analysis in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) such as chromagrams. By using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), it may be possible to learn low-level representations of audio signals, that can be used to extract harmonic features from music.
